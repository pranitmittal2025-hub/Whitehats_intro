Why i want to join WhiteHats:

I am interested in learning cybersecurity stuff from the basics and being part of a community of people that works on real world topics as a team .

Recent cybersecurity news/incident:

I read about the SoundCloud data breach, where unauthorized access exposed personal information of around 29.8 million users. This incident showed how even popular platforms can face major security problems and why cybersecurity practices are essential to protect user data.
